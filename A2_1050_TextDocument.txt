                <h2>What is drone photography?</h2>
                <p>Drone photography is the process of taking still photos and moving pictures with an unmanned aerial
                    vehicle (UAV), usually referred to as a drone or an unmanned aircraft system (UAS).<br>
                    <br>
                    Drone photography enables the recording of pictures and audio/video that would otherwise be
                    impossible
                    for
                    human photographers and videographers. Drones' ability to fly, small size, or resistance to harsh
                    circumstances can
                    all contribute to this capacity. A first-person view (FPV) that would otherwise be difficult to
                    acquire
                    is
                    frequently made possible
                    by drone photography. <br>
                    <br>
                    Drones that have computer vision, facial recognition, object recognition, and other tracking
                    technologies
                    are essentially flying robots.
                    Networking, robotics, and artificial intelligence work together to enable their growing
                    environmental
                    presence (AI). These cutting-edge,
                    artificial intelligence (AI) equipped drones can adapt to their surroundings and carry out a variety
                    of
                    autonomous tasks, including as taking
                    a drone-based selfie (also known as a "dronie") or pursuing a person and collecting photos or videos
                    while
                    they walk or drive.

                <h2>How much should an average drone weight? </h2>
                <p> Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), sometimes known as drones, are increasingly common because they are
                    enjoyable to fly and make it simple to capture stunning aerial images. One of the reasons they are
                    so
                    well-liked
                    is their portability, which allows you to tote one with you when you go on a trek or store one in
                    your
                    carry-on
                    luggage. Let's talk about how heavy some of the modern drones that are more prevalent are. <br>
                    <br>
                    Typically, toy drones weigh between 0.5 and 2 ounces (20 to 60 grams). Consumer drones, meanwhile,
                    typically
                    weigh between 0.5 and 3 lbs (250 to 1,300 grams). Enterprise drones that weigh greater than 13 lbs.
                    or
                    more can weigh over 200 lbs (6 kilos to 100 kilos). <br>
                    <br>
                    Consumer drones can range in weight from being relatively hefty to being on the lighter side. On the
                    other side, since some business or enterprise drones must be rather hefty to complete particular
                    duties,
                    their range
                    simply increases.<br>

            </div>

            <section id="camera">

                <h2>What is the expected camera quality?</h2>
                <p>The camera is the most crucial element to concentrate on if you're wondering how drone photography
                    works.
                    Similar to digital cameras,
                    picture quality varies more depending on the level of quality. The most important camera
                    characteristics
                    to
                    compare when choosing a drone
                    for photography are sensor size, resolution, and support for raw data (RAW) and digital negative
                    file
                    (DNG)
                    formats. These file types give
                    visual editors more post-production creative freedom while storing photos with incredible quality.
                    You
                    should look for picture and video
                    editing apps that handle RAW or DNG files if you plan to enhance drone shots with them.<br>
                    <br>
                    A larger camera sensor can catch more details since it can take in more light than a smaller one.
                    Larger
                    sensors are therefore more appropriate
                    for nighttime and low-light photography. When comparing drone prices for photography, you could
                    discover
                    that models with larger image sensors are
                    typically more expensive. Consider only drones with 1-inch or larger image sensors if you're looking
                    for
                    a
                    professional camera drone. High-end models
                    are available with 4/3-inch complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) sensors, enabling them to
                    take
                    just as detailed pictures as digital
                    single-lens reflex (DSLR) cameras. <br>
                    <br>
                    A drone with at least a 12-megapixel camera makes for the best photography drone. If you want to
                    film
                    videos
                    with your drone, high resolution is also
                    crucial. 4K should be the minimum video resolution in a drone with a professional camera. However,
                    if
                    your
                    main goal is to publish captured footage to
                    social media sites, a drone with a 1080p camera would suffice.<br>

                <h2>Price range for drones?</h2>
                <p>Drones come in a variety of shapes and sizes. They can serve a variety of functions. Drones come in
                    numerous
                    shapes and sizes. Some are used as toys, while others are larger, more versatile drones
                    for photography. <br>
                    <br>
                    A drone can cost anything from $50 to $10,000 on average. Toy drones for beginners cost between $30
                    and
                    $90,
                    while entry-level camera drones cost between $300 and $500. Consumer drones at the mid-level
                    are anticipated to cost between $600 and $1,000. Professional grade drones start at $3,000 and cost
                    more.

                <h2>Different types of drones: </h2>
                <p><strong><u>Entry Level Drone</u></strong>: This kind of drone will work perfectly for you if taking
                    stunning images and films
                    with it excites you more than the excitement of flight control. An entry-level camera drone with
                    outstanding
                    camera performance costs $300 to $500. These drones typically have a 12-megapixel sensor, a
                    1/2.3-inch
                    fixed lens,
                    and a video resolution of 1080p to 2.7K. The true worth of these drones lies in their instability in
                    flight, which,
                    in the absence of a gimbal, can cause blurring and shaking that degrades video quality.</p>

                <p><strong><u>Range Consumer Drone</u></strong>: A mid-level or prosumer drone is your best option if
                    you're
                    considering drone
                    videography
                    as a job or if you're ready to spend more money on a pastime. These drones, which typically cost
                    $500 to
                    $1,000,
                    are made exclusively for high-quality professional photography and filming. Older variants of these
                    pricey drones
                    employ a 1/2.3-inch camera sensor and a 3-axis stabilised camera gimbal, but the newest models
                    include a
                    48-megapixel
                    1/2-inch sensor. In addition to the sophisticated camera, these drones have auto-flying capabilities
                    and
                    object avoidance
                    sensors to increase flight safety. Additionally, you'll discover superior computational capability
                    and
                    potentially more
                    advanced software for improved image processing.</p>

                <p><strong><u>Professional Drones</u></strong>: Photography has been completely altered by professional
                    drones. Film studios are
                    increasingly
                    using these drones more frequently for cinematography and professional-level filming. They start at
                    $3000 and can cost up to
                    $10,000. Typically, these heavy lift drones are big enough to hold all the remote controls in
                    addition
                    to carrying enormous
                    cameras utilised for movie production. Additionally, each one of them has an integrated camera that
                    provides a range of
                    cutting-edge perspectives.</p>

                <h2>More things to condider when choosing a drone:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Battery Life</strong></li>
                    <p>Manufacturers strive to strike a compromise between drone size and battery life because larger,
                        heavier
                        batteries tend to have longer life
                        spans. The downside of a shorter flying time is that it leaves less time for photos, shorter
                        movies,
                        and
                        flexibility. We like drone batteries that
                        last at least 30 minutes, and we advise pilots to purchase a few more (the batteries are
                        rechargeable)
                        so they can fly in the field for a longer period of time.</p>

                    <li><strong>Portability</strong></li>
                    <p>The best drones are lightweight and compact enough to fit into a camera bag or backpack, making
                        them
                        portable enough to be used on a daily
                        basis. Some drones achieve this by being more compact and having folding limbs. Small drones
                        weighing
                        less than 250 grammes are also exempt
                        from the FAA registration requirement.</p>

                    <li><strong>Crash-avoidence Sensors</strong></li>
                    <p>Drone sensors have advanced significantly, and some models can now recognise obstacles coming
                        from
                        any
                        angle and change their flight path to prevent
                        a collision. We are only ready to evaluate drones that can, at the very least, sense impediments
                        approaching from their front, back, and bottom because this technology
                        makes flying so much less stressful. Some modern drones can even track approaching planes and
                        helicopters so you may fly around them without colliding with them.</p>

                    <li><strong>Autonomous Modes</strong></li>
                    <p>Any video drone that is worth purchasing should feature a fail-safe return-home mode that, in the
                        event
                        that you hit a button or the drone loses contact with the
                        controller, immediately returns the aircraft to the launch location. Additionally, we choose
                        drones
                        that
                        are pre-programmed with cinematic autonomous-flight modes. For example,
                        you could tell a drone to follow you as you snowboard down a mountain by pressing a button, or
                        to
                        fly in
                        a circle as you take a dramatic selfie by pressing a button.</p>

                    <li><strong>Intuitive controller </strong></li>
                    <p>The majority of drone controllers have two joysticks for controlling flight and a scattering of
                        buttons
                        for a variety of functions. The functionality of controllers
                        can be expanded even further, frequently in more logical ways, if they include an integrated
                        screen
                        or
                        the ability to connect to a smartphone so you can access new features through an app.</p>

                    <li><strong>Range and flight time </strong></li>
                    <p>The range and flight time of a drone are the two main considerations when purchasing one. A
                        typical
                        flight time and range for the most popular toy drones on the market today are 15 minutes and 100
                        metres,
                        respectively. Only those new to drones who are interested should use these. You are suggested to
                        choose
                        a drone with a flight time of 25 minutes and a range of 3 kilometres if your goal is to snap
                        pictures
                        and
                        record videos. Additionally, there are drones that can fly continuously for six or seven hours,
                        and
                        they
                        are employed in a wide range of industrial applications.</p>
